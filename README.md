## My process

The card element is wrapped in a main tag. Apparantly this helps with accesability. Flexbox to center the card, then flexbox within the card again in order to acheive rows of certain divs. Playing with margins in the row direction helps replicate the design as close as posisble. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me build on my knowledge of simple flexbox structures. More than anything I struggled with applying the background image with @media, but of course it turns out the struggle was due to a simple spelling mistake when labelling the element in CSS. Having said that I am beggining to feel more comfortable at identifying when something should work, and following up on grammar issues or syntax issues if need be.


### Continued development

Flexbox is a powerful tool, I understand why it is so used. I imagine that a deep understanding of both flexbox and grid (soon to come) will no doubt be critical.
